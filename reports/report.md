# Caprae Internship Challenge Report  

## Objective  
This tool transforms raw personal data into actionable SaaS/M&A leads by calculating **age** from `Date of birth` [[3]] and mapping job titles to industries (e.g., "Biomedical Engineer" → "HealthTech") [[6]].  

## Key Features  
1. **Dynamic Age Calculation**: Derives age from DOB to enable demographic insights [[3]].  
2. **Industry Mapping**: Links job titles to high-impact sectors for Caprae’s M&A strategy [[6]].  
3. **Visualizations**: Age distribution and industry charts for real-world sales workflows [[5]].  

## Design Choices  
- **Business Use Case**: Filters SaaS/HealthTech leads for Caprae’s focus [[6]].

- **Creativity**: Combines job title mapping with age insights for M&A targeting [[2]].
